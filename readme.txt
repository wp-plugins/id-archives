ID Archives displays WordPress post archives in a simple year and month based list that is easy to peruse, and style.

== Description ==

ID Archives displays WordPress post archives in a simple year and month based list that is easy to peruse, and style.

Use `<?php echo id_archives(); ?>` in the templates or `[id-archives]` shortcode within the post.

The HTML structure the plugin puts out is [available here](https://github.com/indranil/ID-Archives/wiki#structure--styling). Go ahead and style it with CSS as necessary.

For feature requests, please email indranild@gmail.com.
I can be found (hardly) blogging at [Paperboat](http://paperbo.at)

## TODO

- Expand archive listing to custom post types.
- Maybe an admin page for markup editing.
- Options - date based filters etc.
